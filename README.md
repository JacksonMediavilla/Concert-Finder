# Concert-Finder

Python scripts to assist in finding concerts that are relevant to me.

## About

The "Get Spotify Tracks" script downloads track data from my Spotify "Liked Songs" and "Electronic" playlists. This is where I save most of my music.
The "Concert Finder" script calculates a "relevance" value for each artist in my library. The script then scrapes concert data from venues in Denver, CO. Concert details are printed with the most relevant events first.
I am currently working to add more venues.
