# Concert-Finder

Python scripts to assist in finding concerts that are relevant to me.

## About

The "Get Spotify Tracks" script downloads track data from my Spotify "Liked Songs" and "Electronic" playlists. This is where I save most of my music.
The "Concert Finder" script calculates a "relevance" value for each artist in my library. The script then scrapes concert data from venues in Denver, CO. Concert details are printed with the most relevant events first.
This application currently scrapes data from Red Rocks and Mission Ballroom. I plan to add more venues shortly.
